The South Africa Macroeconomic Database (SAMADB) is a relational database with >10,000 macroeconomic time series for South Africa, obtained from the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) and Statistics South Africa (STATSSA) and updated on a weekly basis. It is accessible through API packages for [R](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=samadb), [Python](https://pypi.org/project/samadb/) and [Julia](https://juliahub.com/ui/Search?q=SAMaDB&type=packages). This repo was created to allow you to report issues with any of these packages. More information about SAMADB can be obtained from the [presenation](https://github.com/Stellenbosch-Econometrics/SA-Nowcast/blob/main/presentation/SAMADB_Nowcasting.pdf).
